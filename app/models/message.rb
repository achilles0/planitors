    Welcome to level 1 of #1planet!

    This is a kind of game and meeting place for all who care about out the single planet all of us have to share. 
    The game is divided into levels, where each new level unlocks some new features of the platform. You level up
    by accepting and completing missions. #1planet is also the place to look for news, tips and advice related to
    saving the climate, bio diversity (that there are many kinds of animals and life forms on the planet), the
    purity of our skies and waters, and actually all the 17 developemnt goals that United Nations have agreed on.

    #1planet is still in its infancy, as you will surely realize soon. We're very happy you want to take part in
    this journey with us, and develop a platform for a thriving community to enjoy. #1planet is developed by a
    not-for profit organizaton by the same name.

    Enjoy, and do let us know what you think!
